        is a Web-based service that the Virginia State Board of Elections (SBE) has
        created to help all Virginia voters -- domestic, military, and overseas --
        with access to voter services and information about voter registration, updating
        your record, and your options for how to vote.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are a registered
        voter in Virginia, you can view your voter record after identifying yourself
        with your voter identification number, or your name, date of birth, and the
        first 4 digits of your social security number, and selecting the locality
        that you reside in. Your voter information includes the name and address that
        SBE currently has on file, as well as your election participation history,
        your electoral districts, and your polling place location. In addition, overseas
        and military voters may be eligible to use another SBE service, online ballot
        marking.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe welcome your <a href=\"https://www.vote.virginia.gov/feedback\">feedback</a>
        about this site and our services.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>"
