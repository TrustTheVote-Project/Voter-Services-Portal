<p>Your voter record indicates that you have registered to vote  as an overseas or military voter. If you are a legal Virginia resident, and need to change  your voter registration, you may use the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)  to register to vote and apply for your absentee ballot at the same time.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fvap.gov/">Federal Voting Assistance Program</a> (FVAP)  web site provides a <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/Files/Cast%20Your%20Ballot/MilitaryAndOverseas/vagVA.pdf">Virginia Voting Assistance Guide</a> (.pdf) explaining how to complete your FPCA and a link to start the application  process. By submitting a completed FPCA in Virginia, you will be sent ballots for all Federal elections in which you are eligible to vote through the end of the next calendar year.</p>
<p>You may also register to vote or  change your registration information and request absentee ballots by filling out and submitting the <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/Files/Forms/VoterForms/VoterRegistrationApplication.pdf">Virginia voter registration application</a> and <a href="http://elections.virginia.gov/Files/Forms/VoterForms/VirginiaAbsenteeBallotApplication.pdf">absentee ballot application</a>. However, using the FPCA is recommended for the  convenience of a single form allowing electronic submission of registration by  fax or scanned email attachment.</p>
