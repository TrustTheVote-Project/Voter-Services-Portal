The Virginia Voter Registration service helps Virginia voters to verify their voter registration eligibility to vote, and view absentee ballot requests and other voter information. Eligible overseas and military voter may also use an option for online ballot marking.

Online ballot marking is another SBE service, which allows you to view your ballot for the upcoming election, indicate your ballot choices online, and have a complete absentee ballot created for you to download, along with instructions for signing and returning your printed online absentee ballot kit. You can also download a blank ballot and mark it by hand. This service is available to overseas and military voters, especially those for whom the postal service is not rapid enough for the paper blank ballot to be mailed from Virginia overseas, and the returned marked ballot arrive back in time to be counted.

You can get started just after you view your voter information online. Look for "Status" near the bottom. If you have been approved for online balloting, you will see "Eligible for online ballot marking" followed by the name of the current election. Click on the election name, and a new window or tab will open, where you can get started with your online ballot.

    To be eligible to use online balloting, you must be an overseas or military voter, approved for absentee voting. If so, then your status will be displayed as "Overseas/Military Absentee Voter". In addition, online balloting is available only in the 45 days prior to each state election. If it is more than 45 days to the next election, online balloting will not be offered.
