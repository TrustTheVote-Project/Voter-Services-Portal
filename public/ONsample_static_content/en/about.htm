The Virginia Voter Services online system is a web-based service that the Virginia Department of Elections (ELECT) has created to help all Virginia voters -- domestic, military, and overseas -- with access to voter services and information about voter registration, updating your record, and your options for how to vote.
</p>
<p>
If you are a registered voter in Virginia, you can view your voter record after identifying yourself with your voter identification number, or your name, date of birth, and the last 4 digits of your social security number, and selecting the locality that you reside in. Your voter information includes the name and address that ELECT currently has on file, as well as your election participation history, your electoral districts, and your polling place location.
