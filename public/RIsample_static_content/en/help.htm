To get started using the Virginia Voter Services online, start by identifying yourself to determine if you are currently registered to vote. You have two options. You may identify yourself by name, date of birth, and the last 4 digits of your social security number. Alternatively, you may identify yourself using your voter identification number, which is printed on the voter information card that was sent to you by your local general registrar's office after you registered to vote. In both options, you must also select from a list of localities to choose the county or city that you reside in.

If you are registered to vote, you will then see your voter registration information, as well as other voter information such as your polling place location, your electoral districts, and your history of voter participation. If any of your voter voter registration information is out of date, you will be provided with information about how to update it. 
If you are not registered to vote, then instead of a voter record, you will be provided with information about how to register to vote. 
If you voter registration is inactive, you will be provided with information about how re-register.
For those registered voters who have requested and been granted address confidentiality, the voter record will <b> not </b> be shown.
