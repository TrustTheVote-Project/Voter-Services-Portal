## Config Guide 6.1
## Configuration keys that toggle the user-visible behavior of 
## the eligibility dialog
##

eligibility:
  ### This config item turns on the VA-specific eligibility requirements. 
  ### When true, the remaining eligibility configuration has no effect
  enable_method_virginia: false
  # enable_method_STATE_NAME: Potentail future functionality
  
  ### When using the default eligibility requirements (i.e. no state-specific eligibility
  ### method is set to `true` above), the following `requirements` config item
  ### specifies a list of eligibility keys. Each of these keys will result in presenting the
  ### user with an interface to confirm that specific eligibility requirement. Each key 
  ### corresponds to a localization item under the eligibility.requirements namespace.
  ### If the given key is a string, the user will be presented with a checkbox with
  ### the string as a lable. If the user checks the box, they are agreeing that they
  ### meet the stated requirement. By default the box will not be checked.
  ### If the given key is a hash of further keys, the following
  ### structure of localiation keys will be assumed:
  ###     eligibility:
  ###       requirements:
  ###         complex_requirement:
  ###           question: "Do you meet this requirement?"
  ###           agree: "I meet the complex requirement"
  ###           disagree: "I do not meet the complex requirement"
  ###           ineligible: "You must meet this complex requirement to vote"
  ### When this structure is provided, the user will be present with the text specified by
  ### `question` followed by a radio button for each of the `agree` and `disagree` statement
  ### If the user selects the radio button corresponding to the `agree` statement,
  ### they will be able to vote. If they select the radio button corresponding to the
  ### `disagree` option, they will be shown the statement specified by `ineligible` if present.
  ### The `ineligible` key is optional.
